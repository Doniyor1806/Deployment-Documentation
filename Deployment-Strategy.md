# Deployment Strategy with Git Tags

## Introduction

In this document, we will outline our deployment strategy with a focus on utilizing Git tags to manage and track important milestones in our project's development cycle.

## Understanding Git Tags

**Git Tags:**
Git tags are immutable references that point to specific commits in the Git history. Unlike branches, which are dynamic pointers, tags are static and used to mark significant points in the project, such as releases or important checkpoints.

**Differences Between Git Tags and Branches:**
- **Branches:** Dynamic pointers that move with new commits, used for ongoing development.
- **Tags:** Static pointers that mark specific commits, used for releases or significant points in the project.

## Utilizing Git Tags in Deployment

**Benefits of Git Tags in Deployments:**
1. **Versioning:** Tags provide a clear versioning system for identifying and referencing specific releases.
2. **Stability:** Tags ensure that a specific state of the code is marked, facilitating reproducible builds and deployments.
3. **Traceability:** Tags help track what code is in production, aiding in troubleshooting and rollback if needed.

## Deployment Strategy Using Git Tags

1. **Development Workflow:**
   - Use feature branches for individual features or bug fixes, merging them into a `develop` branch.
   - Integrate features from `develop` into a `release` branch for final testing.

2. **Tagging for Releases:**
   - Tag commits in the `release` branch with release candidate tags (e.g., `v1.0-rc1`, `v1.0-rc2`).
   - Create a final release tag (e.g., `v1.0`) in the `main` branch after successful testing.

3. **Deployment Process:**
   - Deploy release candidate tags to a staging environment for thorough testing.
   - Deploy the final release tag to the production environment.

4. **Ensuring Stability in Production:**
   - Protect critical branches like `main` to prevent direct commits and ensure only reviewed and tested code is merged.
   - Implement CI/CD pipelines that automate build, test, and deployment processes based on tags.

5. **Rollback Strategy:**
   - Use previous tags to rollback to a known stable state in case of issues with the latest release.

## Example Deployment Workflow

**Scenario:**
Your team is developing a web application. The development is done on feature branches, integrated into `develop`, and then prepared for release in the `release` branch.

**Steps:**
1. **Development Phase:**
   - Develop features on feature branches.
   - Merge feature branches into `develop` after code reviews and testing.

2. **Release Preparation:**
   - Merge `develop` into `release`.
   - Tag the commits in `release` with release candidate tags.

3. **Testing in Staging:**
   - Deploy release candidate tags to staging.
   - Conduct thorough testing and bug fixing.

4. **Final Release:**
   - Merge `release` into `main`.
   - Tag the final release in `main`.

5. **Production Deployment:**
   - Deploy the final release tag to production.

## Conclusion

By incorporating Git tags into our deployment strategy, we can ensure a stable and reliable deployment process. Tags provide versioning, stability, and traceability, making it easier to manage and track deployments throughout the project's lifecycle.
